description: <h2>Oil Products</h2> <p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/amsoil_logo.png"></p> <p>We are proud to offer the full range of <a href="https://www.amsoil.com/">Amsoil</a> products including engine oil, gear oil, transmission fluid, and hydraulic oil. Amsoil is an upgrade over our standard selection of conventional, synthetic blend, and full synthetic options. We stock six different oil grades and any of them can be upgraded to the equivalent grade Amsoil for both passenger vehicles or heavy equipment. You can choose to use Amsoil in an Oil Service you receive from us or we can sell you the Amsoil directly if you want to do your own oil changes. The initial cost for Amsoil products is higher but the long-term benefits are proven.</p> <p>SOCO Industrial chose to stock six grades of the <a href="https://amsoilcontent.com/ams/lit/databulletins/g2880.pdf">Amsoil Signature Series</a> 100% synthetic oils becuase of their superior engineered qualities. However, we can get any Amsoil product within three to five business days. Amsoil products are highly engineered oils that provide wear protection, extreme temperature performance, and fuel efficiency that conventional lubricants just can't touch. To learn more about the difference between other lubricants labeled "Full Synthetic" and Amsoil 100% synthetic lubricants, read <a href="https://blog.amsoil.com/100-synthetic-oil-vs-full-synthetic-oil-whats-the-difference/">this</a> article.</p> <p>When used with Amsoil filters, Amsoil Signature Series lubricants are <a href="https://www.amsoil.com/about/guarantee/">guaranteed</a> up to 25,000 miles or 1-year (whichever comes first) for engine wear protection under normal service conditions and up to 15,000 miles or 1-year (whichever comes first) for engine wear protection under severe service. Amsoil Signature Series oils also have 50% more detergents than the Amsoil OE series, the detergents help keep oil passages clean and battle sludge build up in the engine. Under an <a href="https://www.astm.org/d6891-23.html">ASTM D6891 standard test</a>, Amsoil Signature Series 0W20 oil provided 75% more engine protection against horsepower loss and wear. As Amsoil puts it; "Some may claim that Signature Series is over-engineered. Perfect. It’s not for everyone. It’s for those who want the absolute best engine protection — and it delivers."</p> <p> <h2>Oil Services</h2> </p>  <p> <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/Webstore-Basic-Oil-Change-Passenger-Vehicle.jpg"> </p> <p>SOCO Industrial offers a variety of Oil Services for heavy equipment and passenger vehicles; Basic Engine Oil Services, Premium Engine Oil Service, Hydraulic Oil Services, or we can build a custom service package specific to your fleet.
